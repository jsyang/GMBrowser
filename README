To compile, you will need the Allegro library
and a curl binary.

A Google Maps browser that saves all map tiles
to disk in path ZOOMLEVEL/X_Y.png. 

DRAG the mouse to move your map view.
SCROLL with your mouse wheel to zoom.
RIGHT-CLICK to reload the current view.
(This possibly helps with the crazy colors.)

---------------- additional notes ------------
Bugs: due to load_png not being threadsafe,
the loading of the PNG files gets funky with
each tile havings its own optimized 8bit
palette, each thread (max 4) loads its own PNG
along with its palette which gets a bit fucked.
The palettes override each other non-sequentia-
lly, leading to fuckdom.
The easy/lazy workaround I've put in is the
right click feature that resets the viewport,
reloading the tiles and possibly fixing the
colors (palette) in the process. It's a patch
up job.

Easyfix is implemented: when Atlas crashes, it
generates a fixme.bat file that gets called
when it runs next. The fixme deletes all PNGs
in the offending folder of the crash zoomlevel.
